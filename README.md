Relies on IMDb’s website structure (may break if IMDb updates layout).

Scraping may be slower on weaker connections.

No real-time personalization (based only on genre & type).

🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate IMDb API / TMDB API for more reliable data.

Build a web-based interface (Flask/Streamlit).

Add support for actor/director-based search.

Recommendation engine with machine learning (e.g., collaborative filtering).
